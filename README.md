# A step by step walkthrough of the AWS EC2 Instance
•	What is it? 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 

•	What does it do?

EC2 is a service on AWS that allows users to rent virtual computers to run their own computer applications according to their business needs. The user can launch virtual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage for this virtual machine just as someone would for a real on-premises server. It reduces the needs to estimate traffic by providing means to scale up or down as per the demand and pay as you go.

•	How does it work?

One can choose from a variety of pre-built, templated Amazon Machine Images (AMI). Users can also make their own AMI, which will include all custom libraries, data, programs, and pertinent configuration settings. User can also customize settings with Amazon EC2 by adjusting network access and security. After that, user decides which AMI instances they want to run and whether they want to run in several locations. User can boot, terminate, and monitor as many instances as necessary once user is ready to begin.  The flexibility of the service enables the reduced costs associated with a "pay for what you use" payment approach. User can manage how many resources are being used at any one time and one can quickly expand his/her VM environment to meet utilization spikes or dips. Traditional on-premises hosting provides one with a certain number of resources for a specific period. As a result, users seldom cannot respond rapidly to a change in use as they would in an environment like the dependable, secure, and elastic Amazon EC2 environment.
•	Why do we need it?

One may instantly create virtual computers using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with a little initial starting expenditure in infrastructure. One can host a range of software on an on-demand infrastructure, from basic websites to enterprise-grade web applications. Acts as plug and play. Spot pricing can reduce hosting expenses by 80–90%. Offers choices for auto-scaling and load balancing, develop fault resistant architecture.
Companies can choose EC2 accelerated computing instances if a business wants intensive processing and GPU capacity for gaming, animation, machine-learning, AI, etc.
No pre-existing cost incurred so the user can “pay as go” for only the resources used by the user and nothing else as opposed to on-premises servers. Super easy and convenient to spin up a server in any geographical location in the world without compromising access and security. This makes it super reliable, accessible and secure.
•	Use Cases?

If suddenly a website starts trending on the internet and the number of users increases exponentially, the EC2 server can balance the load automatically and scale as per needed. The business will only pay for the resources needed so it is more cost effective too. If the business had an on-premises server, there is a high chance that the server will overload due to the sudden increase in requests and crash. This can cause the business huge losses. As pose to, if the business decides to invest in more on-premises servers during an off season, those servers won’t be utilized, and the business will still have to pay for the hardware and software cost of it. This is again a loss of money for the business.
